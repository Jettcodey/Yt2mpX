### Built With
[Go-lang](https://go.dev/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Yt2mpX is a simple, lightweight, and fast Go-based backend that interacts with `yt-dlp` to convert YouTube videos into high-quality MP3 & HD MP4 files. It serves as a bridge between a web frontend and `yt-dlp`, handling download requests, tracking progress, and providing MP3 or MP4 files for users to download.

I built this because I was fed up with all those annoying websites. I’m not sure if I’ll actively fix bugs/issues or add new features—I just wanted something quick and easy to set up and use.

Also, this is my first Go project, so apologies in advance!
